## API

### Pinentry

A class for running pinentry programs.

Example:

```
var Pinentry = require("pinentry");
new Pinentry().connect().getPin({desc: "gimme pin"}, function (err, pin) {
	if (err) console.log("error");
	else console.log("got pin", pin);
	this.close();
});
```

For more detailed usage, see `example.js`.

#### new Pinentry()
Create a new pinentry object.

#### pinentry.connect([cmd], [callback])
Run the given pinentry command and connect to it. cmd defaults to "pinentry".
If a callback is provided, it is called when the connection is established,
with an error if there is an error. If a connection error occurs but there is
no callback, an error is event is emitted on the pinentry object instead.

#### pinentry.confirm(options, callback)
Prompt the user to confirm something. If user chooses OK, callback is called
with null arguments). If user chooses Cancel, callback is called with a
PinentryOperationCancelledError object.

#### pinentry.message(options, callback)
Show a message to the user.

#### pinentry.getPin(options, callback)
Ask the user to enter a pin. The callback is called with an error object if
there is an error, and a pin if the user enters a pin.

#### Event: 'error'
Emitted on error response for setting properties. Note that an error for a
confirm/message/getPin call itself is put in the callback instead of an event.

#### Options

Use these parameters for the `confirm`, `message`, and `getPin` methods.

 - `desc`: Description text
 - `prompt`: Heading text
 - `title`: Window title text
 - `ok`: OK button text
 - `cancel`: Cancel button text
 - `error`: Additional text

Other options (unknown use or not working):
`keyinfo`, `repeat`, `repeaterror`, `notok`, `timeout`, `qualitybar`,
`qualitybar_tt`

### PinentryOperationCancelledError

`Pinentry.OperationCancelledError`

Error object returned to callbacks when user cancels a prompt.

### PinentryError

`Pinentry.Error`

Generic error object returned to callbacks.
